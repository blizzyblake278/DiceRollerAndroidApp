# DiceRollerAndroidApp
A Dice roller Android App

This app is still in its early stages, but currently it is being used for school. 
This is created using Android Studio with kotlin at its base language.
Currently the app rolls 3 dice, and updates the 3 dice images based on the numbers rolled. 
The total of the 3 dice rolled is shown.
Per the professor's instructions, we also included an "enhancer" to increase the scores total
based on doubles & triples. 
The total score of each roll is added to the previous score and tallied up at the bottom as SCORE. 

It's worth noting too that the Dice class is supposed to have zero strings within it. 
All strings are within the string.xml file. 

In the future I plan to make this to where you can select different kinds of dice to roll. 
D4, D6, D8, D10, etc.
